/**
 * This command is added to mlAppDeployer so that all the default pipelines are loaded. This gets around an issue
 * where pipelines that have options elements in them - such as the Alerting pipeline - can't be loaded via the Mgmt
 * API because the options element fails schema validation. Loading all the default pipelines when we only need
 * Status Change Handling and Alerting is fine - the unused pipelines just sit there with no impact on anything.
