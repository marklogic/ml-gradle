 * The most minimal ml-gradle file just has one thing - the ml-gradle plugin declaration.

 * Without a gradle.properties file with properties such as mlAppName and mlRestPort, ml-gradle will use some sensible
 * defaults to generate a new application - an app name of my-app, port 8003, and a username/password combo of
 * admin/admin.
