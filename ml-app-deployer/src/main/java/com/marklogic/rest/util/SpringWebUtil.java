 * This class shields callers from the different return types in Spring 5 and Spring 6 when getting a status code object

 * classpath along with spring-web 6.x as well. Examples of this include a Gradle buildscript that uses ml-gradle and
 * a plugin that depends on Spring 6, or a Spring Boot middle tier that needs to use ml-app-deployer.
