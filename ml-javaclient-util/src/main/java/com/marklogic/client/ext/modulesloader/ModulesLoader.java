 * Interface for objects that can load a set of modules via the REST API, which is intended to include not just what the
 * REST API calls "assets" (regular modules), but also options, services, transforms, and namespaces.
 *
 * Note that in both of the methods in this interface, the DatabaseClient is used for loading REST extensions. This is
 * to account for the fact that how search options are loaded (i.e. the URI they're written to) differs based on what
 * REST server they're loaded from. But the implementation is not expected to use this DatabaseClient for loading
 * non-REST modules - that is likely done via an instance of AssetFileLoader that uses the App-Services port by
 * default for loading non-REST modules.
